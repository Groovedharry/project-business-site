# Business Site

Replace this readme with your own information about your project. 

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

We were assigned to code a business site and I decided to make a site like Dollar Shave Club.

## The problem
Planning, I didn't do very much planning this time around as I did last time. I mostly just had an idea of what I wanted to do create it into 3 sections and then have something to click on so you get scrolled down to the different pages. But I did a rough sketch in Figma and started from there nothing more really.

I think my biggest problem was Javascript and I decided for some reason to try to do an animation in CSS.

Javascript was hard because its the first time I am trying to use it and I feel its really confusing and will need more work to better understand it. 

Animation in CSS is probably something I will never do again because its caused me an extreme amount of hassle when it comes to centering it and its been a nightmare to be honest but it was really fun trying it out and trying to solve my problems by googling and asking help from people I know.

If I had more time I would probably recode the entire site as I did some mistakes in the beginning that really made it hard in the later stages of my code which meant I had to spend a lot of time going back and fourth in my code and changing something there and here, if I had just done correct from the beginning I would have probably saved myself a lot of time.
